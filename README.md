# AI Face Mask Detector

A deep learning convolutional neural network (CNN) developed in Python using various libraries including [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/), [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/), and [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) and trained on over 2000 images to identify and classify face images into 5 classes, namely:

1. Cloth mask (cloth)
2. N95 mask (n95)
3. N95 mask with valve (n95v)
4. No face mask (nfm)
5. Surgical mask (srg)
